# VX

A standardized saving format for use in any Cell Machine remake.

Standard is written in the STANDARD.md file.

# Standardized

The VX standard is specified in this repository, and was designed to work for any remake, while also allowing some levels to cleanly work between remakes (though with exceptions)

# Cross-Remake

With Standardized IDs, the saving format can work across multiple standard compliant remakes (as long as you are using standardized cells, if not, it may not always work, unless that other remake has a preprocessor that can make it work).

# Open-Minded

You can request a change to the format (as long as its non-breaking) or extra standardized IDs 

# Expandable

VX supports:
- Non-standardized cells to be saved
- Extra layers
- Data in placeables
- Rotation of placeables
- Data in cells
- Infinite grids

This does not mean that all remakes that implement VX support these, but it means that the saving format allows basically any remake to use it!
