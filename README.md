# VX

A free-to-use, standardized saving format for use in any Cell Machine remake.

Standard is written in the STANDARD.md file.

# Standardized

The VX standard is specified in this repository, and was designed to work for any remake, while also allowing some levels to cleanly work between remakes (though with exceptions)

# Free-to-use

The license is currently not written, but, you are free to implement the VX saving format as well as make your own fork of it.
